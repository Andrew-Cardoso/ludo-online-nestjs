# Ludo Online

[Ludo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo) is a popular game originated from the indian game [Pachisi](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachisi).

I made this project to expand my portfolio and to practice real time conection to multiple clients, low latency database and deploying using Heroku.

This repo is linked to Heroku, available for playing, and I will keep updating and solving bugs whenever I have the time to.

For the complete rules of the game, check the [frontend repository](https://github.com/Andrew-Cardoso/ludo-online-react#readme), built in [React](https://reactjs.org/).
